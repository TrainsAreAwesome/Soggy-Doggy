# Soggy-Doggy
You can use this if you want but it might have bugs

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Copy the .lua file (all of it) on to and run it in a lua runner (eg code.luascript.dev)

2. Info: You (player 1 and player 2) are walking dogs around a lake, and you dont want them to fall in the water!
    You roll the dice and hope that you dont get a high number, if your total number gets to or above 7, the dog jumps in!

3. Dice numbers: 1 takes 1 off your total number. 2 takes 2 off your total number. 3 takes 3 off your total number 
4 adds 1 to your total number. 5 adds 2 to your total number. 6 adds 3 to your total number (your total number can be less than 0)

Update log:

V1.4.3: Bug fix
V1.4.2: Made the game work!
V1.4.1: Added a print so you know what your total number is after rolling the dice

(there were some other versions that lasted like 10 minuits so i am not showing them here)
V1.3: Hopefully made the dice (and the game) work
